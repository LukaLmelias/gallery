# Gallery Portal


Gallerry portal is a simple webapp were users can upload images which will be stored on MongoDb.

The goal was to learn to automate CI/CD process using Jenkins. Here is the script that I used: [Jenkinesfile](https://github.com/LukaLmelias/gallery/blob/master/Jenkinsfile)

I used webhooks such that git commits triggers deployement of the gallery webapp.
